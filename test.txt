PART 1: Slow Takeoff
   "The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting
   than the question of whether a submarine can swim."
   - Edsger W. Dijkstra
Chapter 1: Lobsters
   Manfred's on the road again, making strangers rich.
   It's a hot summer Tuesday, and he's standing in the plaza in front of
   the Centraal Station with his eyeballs powered up and the sunlight
   jangling off the canal, motor scooters and kamikaze cyclists whizzing
   past and tourists chattering on every side. The square smells of water
   and dirt and hot metal and the fart-laden exhaust fumes of cold
   catalytic converters; the bells of trams ding in the background, and
   birds flock overhead. He glances up and grabs a pigeon, crops the
   shot, and squirts it at his weblog to show he's arrived. The bandwidth
   is good here, he realizes; and it's not just the bandwidth, it's the
   whole scene. Amsterdam is making him feel wanted already, even though
   he's fresh off the train from Schiphol: He's infected with the dynamic
   optimism of another time zone, another city. If the mood holds,
   someone out there is going to become very rich indeed.
   He wonders who it's going to be.

   Manfred sits on a stool out in the car park at the Brouwerij 't IJ,
   watching the articulated buses go by and drinking a third of a liter
   of lip-curlingly sour gueuze. His channels are jabbering away in a
   corner of his head-up display, throwing compressed infobursts of
   filtered press releases at him. They compete for his attention,
   bickering and rudely waving in front of the scenery. A couple of punks
   - maybe local, but more likely drifters lured to Amsterdam by the
   magnetic field of tolerance the Dutch beam across Europe like a pulsar
   - are laughing and chatting by a couple of battered mopeds in the far
   corner. A tourist boat putters by in the canal; the sails of the huge
   windmill overhead cast long, cool shadows across the road. The
   windmill is a machine for lifting water, turning wind power into dry
   land: trading energy for space, sixteenth-century style. Manfred is
   waiting for an invite to a party where he's going to meet a man he can
   talk to about trading energy for space, twenty-first-century style,
   and forget about his personal problems.
   He's ignoring the instant messenger boxes, enjoying some
   low-bandwidth, high-sensation time with his beer and the pigeons, when
   a woman walks up to him, and says his name: "Manfred Macx?"
   He glances up. The courier is an Effective Cyclist, all wind-burned
   smooth-running muscles clad in a paean to polymer technology: electric
   blue lycra and wasp yellow carbonate with a light speckling of anti
   collision LEDs and tight-packed air bags. She holds out a box for him.
   He pauses a moment, struck by the degree to which she resembles Pam,
   his ex-fiance.
   "I'm Macx," he says, waving the back of his left wrist under her
   bar-code reader. "Who's it from?"
   "FedEx." The voice isn't Pam's. She dumps the box in his lap, then
   she's back over the low wall and onto her bicycle with her phone
   already chirping, disappearing in a cloud of spread-spectrum
   emissions.
   Manfred turns the box over in his hands: it's a disposable supermarket
   phone, paid for in cash - cheap, untraceable, and efficient. It can
   even do conference calls, which makes it the tool of choice for spooks
   and grifters everywhere.
   The box rings. Manfred rips the cover open and pulls out the phone,
   mildly annoyed. "Yes? Who is this?"
   The voice at the other end has a heavy Russian accent, almost a parody
   in this decade of cheap on-line translation services. "Manfred. Am
   please to meet you. Wish to personalize interface, make friends, no?
   Have much to offer."
   "Who are you?" Manfred repeats suspiciously.
   "Am organization formerly known as KGB dot RU."
   "I think your translator's broken." He holds the phone to his ear
   carefully, as if it's made of smoke-thin aerogel, tenuous as the
   sanity of the being on the other end of the line.
   "Nyet - no, sorry. Am apologize for we not use commercial translation
   software. Interpreters are ideologically suspect, mostly have
   capitalist semiotics and pay-per-use APIs. Must implement English more
   better, yes?"
   Manfred drains his beer glass, sets it down, stands up, and begins to
   walk along the main road, phone glued to the side of his head. He
   wraps his throat mike around the cheap black plastic casing, pipes the
   input to a simple listener process. "Are you saying you taught
   yourself the language just so you could talk to me?"
